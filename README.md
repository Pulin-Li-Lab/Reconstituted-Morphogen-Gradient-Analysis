# Reconstituted-Morphogen-Gradient-Analysis
Used to quantify the 1D and 2D gradients of reconstituted morphogen gradients.

2D Gradients
1. Use a cell tracking program to track individual sender cells
2. Run all of ExtractSenderPos
3. Save the calculated average background matrix as "background" 
4. Run Gradient2D_analysis
5. Run Gradient2D_averagepos

1D gradients
1. Run background calculation section of ExtractSenderPos(2nd part) 
2. Save the calculated average background matrix as "background" 
3. Run Gradient2D_analysis
4. Run Gradient2D_averagepos
